Next, I trained a <bold>custom model<bold> myself that can track the ball in the video so that I can find the exact moment the attacking player passes the ball. Finally, I use <bold>Hough-Line Transformations<bold> to find the goal-line so that my program can draw the offsides lines parallel to the goal-line.",
