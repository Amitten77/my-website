The theme was to create a retro video game that encapsulated our company's themes in 16 hours. So in a team of five, we created Crossy Tractor, a remake of Crossy Road with some twists.",
            "longerDes": "So to play our game, you can use the WASD keypad to control a combine, and the goal is to collect the corn while avoiding the runaway animals. Run into the animals three times, and you're out! I created a <bold>live leaderboard<bold> for our application using <bold>MongoDB<bold> and connected it to our frontend using <bold>Express<bold>. I also created some of the game logic in <bold>Pixi.js<bold> such as defining player movement and organizing the graphics drawn by our graphics team.",

I used <bold>AWS S3<bold> to store large sets of training images, and <bold>AWS EC2<bold> to train my <bold>Tensorflow Image Classification<bold> models to minimize the overhead on my computer. We also had to sort the glass bottles by color, so I used <bold>image segmentation<bold> to get the color of the glass. For our NLTK model, we used named entity recognition, <bold>neural networks<bold>, and synonyms to help our program understand the descriptions of trash.",
